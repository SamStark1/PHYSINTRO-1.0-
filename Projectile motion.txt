	The motion of object in two dimensions is explained by two main principles that are kinematic principles and Newton's laws of motion. The motion in two dimensions is called the motion of projectiles. The projectile object is one on which is moved under the force of gravity.  Some examples of projectiles are like an object is dropped from its rest condition on which there is no effect of air resistance. An object is thrown from vertical under negligible effect of air resistance an object and if it is thrown in up direction at a horizontal angle is considered in a projectile motion.
