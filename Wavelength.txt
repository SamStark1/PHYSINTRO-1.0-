	Wavelength is the distance between the crests of a wave. Many different things can move like waves, like strings, water, the air (sound waves),\nthe ground (earthquakes), and light can be treated as a wave. Wavelength is represented with the Greek letter lambda. It is equal to the velocity of the wave,\ndivided by the frequency. Wavelength is expressed in units of meters (m).	The formula to find Frequency is: lamda(w) = v / f
